# Foundations of our startup, poet.ic

### Don’t hire for culture fit.

We know that original and creative solutions come from people with diverse backgrounds working together. It’s also why we don’t use standardised tests for potential candidates

### Cut the crap.

Call out each others’ bullshit. Even if it’s you’re boss. Or the CEO. Or the janitor. Trust us, they’ll thank you for it later.

### Open Source as much as you can.

If your only advantage is software that can be replicated by a kid in his garage, it isn’t an advantage at all.
